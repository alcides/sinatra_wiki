h1. Sinatra Wiki

This is a small sinatra wiki for pages written in Textile.

Just create a folder called wiki at the same level at this app. Drop .textile files and folders inside.

One page can has subpages. Just create a folder with the same name as the file. Eg: @/topic@ will show @topic.textile@ contents and the subpages in @topic@ folder.

You can then use whatever VCS you want with your wiki folder. For my personal usage, I prefer git.
